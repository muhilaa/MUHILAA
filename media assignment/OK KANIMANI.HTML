                    <P>Prior to the film's release, the soundtrack was well received and the promotional activity of the film on social media also garnered praise.[7] O Kadhal Kanmani was released on 17 April 2015 and won positive reviews from critics, praising the lead pair's performances and the quality of the film's technical aspects.[8] The film became a financial blockbuster at the box office, performing extremely well in Indian multiplexes and overseas.[9] The film was later remade into Hindi as Ok Jaanu in 2017.</P>
